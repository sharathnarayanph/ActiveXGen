Active X object replacement for Chrome by pushing an executable from server side

ActiveX Object for IE VS Chrome

  The existing ActiveX object allows the IE browser to directly run methods exposed through DLL. 
  But Chrome doesn't allow this for security purposes.
  An alternate solution for legacy applications is by pushing a stream of .exe from server side which can be run in the client machine.
  The .exe holds the code that can mock the Active X.
